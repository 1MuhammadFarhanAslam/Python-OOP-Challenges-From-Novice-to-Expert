    "## Challenge 1: The `Book` Class 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is all about creating your first blueprint (a **class**) and then building an actual object from that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a simple application to keep track of your personal library. The most fundamental thing you need to represent is a book. This class will act as the digital version of a physical book on your shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the Blueprint:** Define a class named `Book`.\n",
    "2.  **Define its Properties:** The class needs a constructor (`__init__` method) that takes three arguments: `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Inside the constructor, store these values as attributes on the object (e.g., `self.title = title`).\n",
    "3.  **Make it Readable:** Implement the special `__str__` method. When someone tries to `print()` an object of your class, this method should return a nicely formatted string describing the book, like: `\"The book '{title}' by {author} has {pages} pages.\"`\n",
    "4.  **Create an Object:** After defining the class, create an actual instance (an object) of the `Book` class. For example, create a book titled \"1984\", written by \"George Orwell\", with 328 pages.\n",
    "5.  **Test Your Code:** Print the book object you created. Thanks to your `__str__` method, you should see the descriptive sentence as the output."

    "## Challenge 3: The `BankAccount` 💰\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge introduces the idea of managing an object's internal state and protecting its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You're creating a simple application for a bank. The most crucial piece is the customer's bank account. You need to create a class that can handle deposits and withdrawals while ensuring the account balance is never manipulated incorrectly (like withdrawing more money than is available).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the `BankAccount` Class:** Define a class with this name.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize the Balance:** The constructor should initialize a `balance` attribute. To signify that this attribute is for internal use and shouldn't be changed directly from outside the class, name it `_balance` (a single leading underscore). This is a common Python convention for \"protected\" attributes.\n",
    "3.  **Create a `deposit(amount)` Method:** This method should accept a numerical `amount` and add it to the `_balance`.\n",
    "4.  **Create a `withdraw(amount)` Method:** This method should subtract the `amount` from the `_balance`. **Crucially**, you must add a check to ensure the user cannot withdraw more money than they have. If they attempt to, print an \"Insufficient funds\" message and do not change the balance.\n",
    "5.  **Create a `get_balance()` Method:** This method should not take any arguments and should simply return the current value of `_balance`.\n",
    "6.  **Test Your Class:**\n",
    "      * Create an instance of `BankAccount` with an initial balance.\n",
    "      * Try depositing some money and check if the balance updates correctly.\n",
    "      * Try withdrawing a valid amount and check the balance.\n",
    "      * Try withdrawing more money than is in the account and verify that the \"Insufficient funds\" message appears and the balance remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in this Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **State Management:** The `_balance` attribute represents the object's current state.\n",
    "  * **Encapsulation (by convention):** Using a leading underscore (`_`) to signal that an attribute is intended for internal use.\n",
    "  * **Conditional Logic:** Using `if/else` statements within a method to control its behavior based on the object's state.\n",
    "  * **Getter Methods:** A method (`get_balance`) whose primary purpose is to provide controlled access to an object's attribute.\n",

Instead of writing a separate function for each shape type (`calculate_rectangle_area`, `calculate_triangle_area`), polymorphism allows you to have a single, clean approach.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The bank from Challenge 3 is concerned about security. While using a single underscore (`_balance`) relies on a \"gentleman's agreement\" among programmers, they want a stronger guarantee that no one can accidentally (or intentionally) modify an account's balance from outside the class. Python provides a mechanism for this: **name mangling**.\n",

    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Modify the `BankAccount` Class:** Take your `BankAccount` class from Challenge 3.\n",
    "2.  **Make the Balance Private:** Change the name of the `_balance` attribute to `__balance` (with a **double underscore** at the beginning). This tells Python to \"mangle\" the attribute's name, making it very difficult to access from outside the class.\n",
    "3.  **Update Internal References:** Make sure your `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods are now using `self.__balance` to refer to the private attribute.\n",
    "4.  **Test Your Class:**\n",
    "      * Create an instance of the `BankAccount`.\n",
    "      * Verify that your `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods still work perfectly.\n",
    "      * **Crucially**, after creating the object, try to access the balance directly from outside the class using `account.__balance`.\n",
    "      * Observe the `AttributeError`. This error proves that encapsulation is working—the internal data is now properly hidden and can only be changed via the methods you designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in this Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **True Encapsulation:** Hiding an object's internal state to protect it from outside interference.\n",
    "  * **Name Mangling:** Python's mechanism for making attributes private. When you use `__attribute`, Python internally renames it to `_ClassName__attribute`, making it hard to guess and access directly. This is a stronger form of protection than the single-underscore convention.\n",

    "## Challenge 12: `Vector` Math ➕\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a physics engine for a game or a graphics application. You constantly need to work with 2D vectors to represent positions, velocities, and forces. A vector has both direction and magnitude (represented by `x` and `y` coordinates). A common operation is adding two vectors together. Instead of writing a function like `add_vectors(v1, v2)`, wouldn't it be more natural and readable to just write `v1 + v2`? This challenge is about making that possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the `Vector` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * It should be initialized with `x` and `y` coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Implement Addition (`__add__`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Implement the special method `__add__(self, other)`. This method is automatically called when you use the `+` operator.\n",
    "      * It should take another `Vector` object (`other`) as an argument.\n",
    "      * It must return a **new** `Vector` object whose `x` is the sum of the two vectors' x-coordinates, and whose `y` is the sum of their y-coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Implement Subtraction (`__sub__`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Similarly, implement the `__sub__(self, other)` method for the `-` operator.\n",
    "      * It should also return a new `Vector` object representing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Implement a Readable Representation (`__str__`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Implement the `__str__(self)` method to return a clean, readable string representation, such as `Vector(x, y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Test Your Vector Math:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Create two `Vector` objects (e.g., `v1 = Vector(2, 3)` and `v2 = Vector(3, 4)`).\n",
    "      * Add them together using the `+` operator and store the result in a new variable (`v3 = v1 + v2`).\n",
    "      * Print all three vectors to see the original vectors and the result of the addition.\n",
    "      * Do the same for subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in this Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Operator Overloading:** \"Overloading\" an operator like `+` or `-` means defining how it should behave when used with objects of your custom class.\n",
    "  * **Special Methods (Dunder Methods):** Methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, and `__str__` that have special meaning in Python and allow you to integrate your classes with Python's native syntax.\n",

    "### Real-World Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You're creating a digital card game like Poker, Blackjack, or Solitaire. The first and most fundamental component you need is a standard 52-card deck. This `Deck` object will be responsible for creating the cards, shuffling them, and dealing them out one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a `Card` Class (Helper Class):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * This will be a simple class to hold data.\n",
    "      * Its constructor should accept a `suit` and a `rank` (e.g., \"Hearts\", \"Ace\") and store them as attributes.\n",
    "      * It's also helpful to have a `__str__` method that returns a readable string like `\"Ace of Spades\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create the `Deck` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * You'll need to import Python's `random` module for shuffling.\n",
    "      * The `Deck`'s constructor (`__init__`) should do the following:\n",
    "          * Create an attribute `self.cards`, which is a list.\n",
    "          * Create the four suits (\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\") and the thirteen ranks (\"2\", \"3\", ..., \"10\", \"Jack\", \"Queen\", \"King\", \"Ace\").\n",
    "          * Use nested loops to create all 52 unique `Card` objects and add them to the `self.cards` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Implement Special Methods and Actions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **`__len__(self)`:** Implement this special method so that when you call `len(my_deck)`, it returns the number of cards currently in the `self.cards` list.\n",
    "      * **`shuffle(self)`:** This method should use `random.shuffle()` to randomize the order of the cards in the `self.cards` list.\n",
    "      * **`deal(self)`:** This method should remove and return the *last* card from the `self.cards` list. Using `list.pop()` is perfect for this. Make sure to add a check: if the deck is empty, it should return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Test Your Deck:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Create an instance of your `Deck`.\n",
    "      * Check its initial length using `len()`.\n",
    "      * Shuffle the deck.\n",
    "      * Deal one card and print it.\n",
    "      * Check the new length of the deck to see that it has decreased by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in this Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Composition:** Your `Deck` object is *composed of* many `Card` objects. This is a fundamental \"has-a\" relationship in OOP.\n",
    "  * **Helper Classes:** The `Card` class exists primarily to support the `Deck` class.\n",
    "  * **Special Methods (`__len__`):** Making your custom objects work with built-in Python functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "      * Create a `Playlist` instance.\n",
    "      * Create a few `Song` instances and add them to the playlist using your `add_song` method.\n",
    "      * Use square brackets (`playlist[0]`) to get and print the first song.\n",
    "      * Create a new `Song` object.\n",
    "      * Use square brackets (`playlist[1] = new_song`) to replace the second song in the playlist.\n",
    "      * Print the second song again to verify that it has been updated.\n",
    "\n",

    "This one introduces a powerful Python feature called the `@property` decorator. It lets you create methods that you can access like attributes, giving you the best of both worlds: the simplicity of attribute access and the power of method logic.\n",

    "## Challenge 15: `Temperature` Converter 🌡️\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You're creating a scientific or weather application where users might work with different temperature scales. You decide that your program will always store temperature in Celsius internally for consistency, but you want to provide a convenient way for users to get and set the temperature in Fahrenheit without having to call conversion methods manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the `Temperature` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * The constructor should accept a temperature in `celsius` and store it as a private attribute, `__celsius`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create a \"Getter\" Property for Fahrenheit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Define a method called `fahrenheit()`.\n",
    "      * Above this method, add the `@property` decorator. This turns the method into a \"getter\" that can be accessed like an attribute (e.g., `temp.fahrenheit`).\n",
    "      * This method should calculate and return the temperature in Fahrenheit using the formula: `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Create a \"Setter\" Property for Fahrenheit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Define another method, also named `fahrenheit(self, value)`.\n",
    "      * Above this method, add the `@fahrenheit.setter` decorator. This links it to the getter and allows you to assign a value to it (e.g., `temp.fahrenheit = 212`).\n",
    "      * The `value` parameter will be the Fahrenheit temperature being assigned.\n",
    "      * Inside this method, you must convert the incoming Fahrenheit `value` back to Celsius using the formula `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9` and store the result in your private `__celsius` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Test Your Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Create a `Temperature` object with an initial Celsius value (e.g., 0°C).\n",
    "      * Print the `fahrenheit` attribute to see the converted value (should be 32).\n",
    "      * Now, set the `fahrenheit` attribute to a new value (e.g., 212).\n",
    "      * To verify that the setter worked correctly, you'll need a way to see the internal Celsius value. Add a simple `get_celsius()` method that returns `__celsius`. Print the new Celsius value (it should now be 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in this Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`@property` Decorator:** A Pythonic way to create managed attributes. It lets you run code (like a calculation) when an attribute is accessed.\n",
    "  * **Getters:** The method decorated with `@property` that is run when you *read* an attribute.\n",
    "  * **Setters:** The method decorated with `@<property_name>.setter` that is run when you *assign a value to* an attribute.\n",
    "  * **Encapsulation:** The internal storage (`__celsius`) is hidden from the user. They interact with the object through the clean, public-facing `fahrenheit` property.\n",
